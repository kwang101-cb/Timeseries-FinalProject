```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Data Loading

```{r initial_analysis, echo=TRUE}
data <- read.csv("IMPCH.csv")
impch <- data$IMPCH

impch_ts <- ts(impch, start=c(1985,1), frequency=12)
plot(impch_ts)
```

## Preprocessing
We can do some analysis here on trend / seasonality/ whatever. We can also split our training data now.
```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
# TODO: normalize dataset, will need to in all likelihood. Run tests for all those things
```


## Model Fitting
Do our ARIMA / EPS / VAR / all the model fitting here
```{r model_fit, echo=TRUE}
# Fit at least three different types of models for evaluation. We can choose one of the sliding windows to use here as well
```



## Model Forecasting
Do the extra stuff here
```{r forecast, echo=TRUE}
```

## Data Source
**US Imports of Goods from China (1985-2025)**
- **Source:** [FRED - Federal Reserve Economic Data](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IMPCH)
- **Description:** Monthly US imports of goods from China on a customs basis, measured in millions of dollars
- **Coverage:** Records how trade volumes with China have evolved over time, including shifts due to trade policy, global demand, and supply chain dynamics

## Problem Statement
This project aims to model and forecast future monthly import values from China using time-series methods such as:
- ARIMA models
- Exponential smoothing
- State-space models

The analysis accounts for:
- Trends and seasonality in trade patterns
- Structural breaks (e.g., tariffs, pandemic-related disruptions)
- Trade policy impacts
- Supply chain shocks
